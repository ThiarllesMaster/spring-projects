- This project used to explain the @Qualifier: When one super class AnimalBean is called but there is 2 classes
which extends from AnimalBean. To resolve we use the annotation @Qualifier("name bean dog or cat")
- The use of BeanPostProcessor to load when the container starts 
- Use of @Autowired in the constructor is not required
